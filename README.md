<h2 align="center">Export the page and deploy</h2>

Once a page is built, one can use the 'Export' button to obtain the full HTML code of that page.

When deploying the exported page to a server, the external static assets must be hosted on the server.

To achieve this, replace the `http://localhost:3000/` with `backend/lib/generator.class.php`, with the target server address, for example, `http://example.com`.

Make sure the external linked static assets are available on the target server. For example, the folder available at `http://localhost:3000/css/fonts` must be uploaded to `http://example.com/css/fonts`.

Then, restart the project and import/export again.

<h2 align="center">Import</h2>

The exported html contains importable scripts.

To import:
1. Click on import button
2. Copy and paste the previously exported html.
